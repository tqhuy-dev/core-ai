      "  • Lighting is bright, with a neutral colour palette (beige, white, light wood).\n",
      "  • Four smaller images on the right show different stages or angles of the kitchen installation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical Details :\n",
      "  • Overlaid text in the main image includes:\n",
      "    – \"Drill and wire in extractor fan\" with a large yellow arrow pointing to the left wall.\n",
      "    – \"Fit mantle and appliances\" in large yellow text across the lower half.\n",

      "    – A blue double-headed arrow labeled \"5ft\" spans the width of the wall beneath the clock.\n",
      "  • The smaller images on the right are vertically stacked, each showing different progress points (e.g., cabinetry, appliances, construction materials).\n",
      "  • The top-right inset has a blue circle and arrow, possibly indicating a measurement or focus area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spatial Relationships :\n",
      "  • The extractor fan location is indicated on the left wall above the cabinets.\n",
      "  • The 5ft measurement is marked horizontally on the back wall, below the clock.\n",
      "  • The kitchen island is centrally placed in the foreground, with tools and materials on the floor.\n",
      "  • The smaller images provide context for the main image, showing before/after or different installation steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Analysis :\n",
      "  • The figure serves as a visual checklist or progress tracker for kitchen installation, with clear spatial cues for where specific tasks (extractor fan, mantle, appliances) are to be completed.\n",

      "Scene Overview :\n",
      "  • The main subject is a brick wall with a central opening, partially demolished, viewed from a straight-on perspective.\n",
      "  • The image is overlaid with a translucent grey box containing the instruction: \"Remove highlighted brick work to create recess\".\n",
      "  • Two vertical red rectangles highlight the left and right sides of the opening, indicating the specific brickwork to be removed.\n",

      "  • Main subject is a brick wall with a white, rectangular box (possibly a vent or electrical fixture) embedded and broken, exposing dark material inside.\n",
      "  • The box is highlighted by a thick red rectangle, drawing attention to the damage.\n",
      "  • The upper edge of the wall and ceiling show peeling paint and dark stains, possibly mold or water damage.\n",
      "  • Lighting is ambient, with no strong shadows; colours are muted browns and whites.\n",

      "  • The red rectangle serves to focus attention on the specific area of concern. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.116,t=0.127,r=0.279,b=0.240), with ID c18c097a-396b-4034-99e1-23f87ec21aab -->\n",
